### Question
Two number sum:
Write a function that that takes in a non-empty array of distinct
integers and an integer representing a target sum. If any two numbers
in the input array sum up to the target sum, the function should return
them in an array. If no two numbers sum up to the target sum, he function should
return an empty array. Assume that there will be at most one pair of numbers
summing up to the target sum.

Sample Input: `[3,5,-4,8,11,1,-1,6], 10`

Sample Output: `[-1,11]`

There are two solutions implemented with time complexity `O(n) and O(nlog(n))` with
space complexity of `O(n) and O(1)` respectively.
